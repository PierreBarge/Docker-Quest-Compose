Here's how to start your Wordpress project:

=> Make sure Docker Engine is installed and running.

=> Create a .env file, which is a copy of .env.sample, and change its values of 'YOUR_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_MYSQL_DB_NAME', 'YOUR_MYSQL_USER_NAME', and 'YOUR_MYSQL_DATABASE_PASSWORD' with your own.

=> Open your terminal where your project is, and type this command:

`docker compose up -d`

=> You're good to go!!
